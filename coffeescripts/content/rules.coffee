        "ABILITIES":
            name: "Abilities"
            text: """Some of the text on condition, damage, ship, and upgrade cards describe <strong>abilities</strong>. These abilities consist of a timing and an effect.<br> • Unless a card ability uses the word “may” or has the <strong>“Action:”</strong> or <strong>“Attack:”</strong> headers, the ability is mandatory and must be resolved. <br> • A ship cannot spend or remove tokens that belong to another ship unless an effect explicitly states otherwise. Similarly, a ship cannot spend, modify, or remove die results that belong to another ship unless an effect explicitly states otherwise.<br> • If multiple abilities resolve at the same time, the players use the ability queue to determine the order in which the abilities resolve. <br>• A destroyed ship’s abilities remain active until that ship is removed unless the ability specifies a different timing for the effect to end, such as “until the end of the Engagement Phase.” Such effects remain active until the end of the specified time.<br><br><h5>Pilot and Ship Abilities</h5>Some ship cards have abilities in addition to or instead of flavor text. All limited ships have unique, personalized pilot abilities instead of flavor text. Some ships have ship abilities on their ship cards listed below their pilot ability or flavor text. Ships of the same ship type all have the same ship ability.<br><br><h5>Replacement Effects</h5>Some abilities are substitutive in nature—they replace how an effect would normally resolve. These abilities use the words “would” and “instead.” <br>• Replacement effects are not added to the end of the ability queue as they are resolved at the timing of the effect they are replacing. <br>• When a replacement effect resolves, the replaced effect is treated as having not occurred. <br>◊ For example, Jyn Erso’s ability says “If a friendly ship at range 0–3 would gain a focus token, it may gain 1 evade token instead.” If this ability is used, an effect that triggers after a ship gains a focus token cannot trigger. <br>• If there are multiple replacement effects that could substitute for the same effect, only one effect can be substituted for the original effect. <br>◊ For example, a ship is about to gain a focus token and has both the ability “Before you would gain a focus token, gain an evade token instead” and the ability “Before you would gain a focus token, gain a calculate token instead.” Only one of those abilities could be resolved.<br><br><h5>Paying Costs</h5>A ship can pay a cost for an effect only if the effect can be resolved. <br>• For example, GNK “Gonk” Droid’s ability says “<strong>Action:</strong> Spend 1 %CHARGE% to recover 1 shield.” The ship cannot spend the charge if it has no inactive shields.<br> • Replacement effects can replace a cost that a ship would pay for an effect. If a cost is replaced in this way, the effect is still resolved."""
        "ABILITY QUEUE":
            name: "Ability Queue"
            text: """The <strong>ability queue</strong> is used to resolve the timing of multiple abilities that trigger during the same timing window. Abilities are resolved from the front of the queue to the back of the queue. These abilities are added to the back of the ability queue using the following rules:<br>1. If both players have abilities that triggered from the same event, the abilities are added to the ability queue in player order.<br> 2. If a player has multiple abilities that triggered from the same event, that player chooses the order that those abilities are added to the ability queue. <br>3. If resolving an effect from the ability queue triggers additional effects, they are added to the front of the ability queue using the above rules. <br>See Appendix for 2 examples of the ability queue.<br> • If there are game effects that share the same timing window as a player’s ability, the game effect is resolved first.<br> ◊ For example, if a ship performs a red barrel roll and the ship has an ability that triggers after it performs a barrel roll, the ship gains a stress token before the other ability is resolved.<br> • If an ability’s requirements are not met, it cannot be added to the ability queue. For example, at the start of the Engagement Phase, if a ship has an ability that requires it to be tractored, but that ship is not tractored, that ability cannot be added to the queue. The ship cannot add the ability to the queue even if another ability also added to the queue at the start of the Engagement Phase would cause that ship to become tractored upon its resolution. <br>• If a ship would be removed while there are one or more abilities in the queue, do not remove that ship until there are no abilities in the queue."""

White is the least difficult, then red, then purple. <br>◊ As a cost to attempt to perform a red action, a ship must gain 1 stress token. <br>◊ As a cost to attempt to perform a purple action, a ship must spend 1 %FORCE%. <br>◊ If a ship is instructed to perform an action, the action is white unless stated otherwise. <br>◊ If two or more effects would alter the color of an action from its default color (e.g. “treat the action as red” ), the action is treated as the most restrictive of those colors. <br>• There is no maximum limit to the number of actions a ship can perform over the course of a round, but a ship cannot perform the same action more than once during a single round, or perform an action it has failed this round. <br>◊ If a ship has multiple damage cards with the same name, each damage card’s ability is a different action. <br>◊ Some cards have multiple <strong>“Action:”</strong> headers, each of which indicates a different action. <br>◊ Game effects such as “gain 1 focus token,” “boost,” or “acquire a lock” are not actions, and a ship can resolve these game effects any number of times each round. Game effects such as “perform a %FOCUS% action,” “perform a %BOOST% action,” or “perform a %LOCK% action” are actions, and therefore each ship can perform each of these actions only once per round. <br>• During the Perform Action step of a ship’s activation, the ship may perform an action. <br>• A ship can choose not to perform an action during the Perform Action step or when granted an action."""

Execute Maneuver:</strong> The ship executes the maneuver selected on the revealed dial.<br><strong>3. Perform Action:</strong> The ship may perform one action.<br><br>After all ships have activated, players proceed to the Engagement Phase.<br>• If a player has multiple ships with the same initiative value, that player activates them in any order—finishing the entire activation for one ship before activating another ship of the same initiative value.<br>• If multiple players have ships with the same initiative value, player order is used to determine the sequence. The first player activates all of their ships with that initiative value in any order, then the second player activates all of their ships with that initiative value in any order.<br>• When a ship activates, if it skips the Reveal Dial step, it cannot resolve any abilities that trigger after the ship reveals its dial.<br>• A stressed ship cannot execute red maneuvers or perform actions.<br>• If a stressed ship attempts to execute a red maneuver, the ship executes a stress maneuver instead. The stress maneuver is a white [%STRAIGHT% 2] maneuver.

A ship is <strong>in</strong> an arc if any part of its base is inside that area.<br>• Arcs are measured beyond the base of ships. The portion of any object that lies beneath a ship is not in any of those ship’s arcs.<br><br><h5>Standard Arcs</h5>There are three types of <strong>standard arcs</strong> created from the crossed diagonal arc lines:<br><strong>1. Front arc (%FRONTARC%):</strong> This arc projects in the same direction that the ship is facing. Most ships have a primary %FRONTARC% weapon. Almost all %CANNON%, %TORPEDO%, and %MISSILE% weapons use this arc.<br><strong>2. Side arcs (%LEFTARC%, %RIGHTARC%):</strong> These arcs are on the left (%LEFTARC%) or right (%RIGHTARC%) side of ships.<br><strong>3. Rear arc (%REARARC%):</strong> This arc projects in the opposite direction that the ship is facing. Some ships have a primary %REARARC% weapon.<br><br><h5>Bullseye Arc</h5>Inside of the front arc, each ship has a bullseye arc.<br><strong>Bullseye arc (%BULLSEYEARC%):</strong> This arc is found inside the %FRONTARC%. If something is in a ship’s %BULLSEYEARC%, it is also in its %FRONTARC%.<br>• The %BULLSEYEARC% is the width and length of the range ruler.<br>• There is no intrinsic effect when a ship attacks a ship in its %BULLSEYEARC%, but card abilities may refer to it.<br><br><h5>Full Arcs</h5>There are two <strong>full arcs</strong> that use the midway line instead of the printed arc lines.<br><strong>1. Full front arc (%FULLFRONTARC%):</strong> This arc covers all of the area in front of the ship.<br>Some ships have primary %FULLFRONTARC% weapons.<br><strong>2. Full rear arc (%FULLREARARC%):</strong> This arc covers all of the area behind the ship. <br>Using the %FULLFRONTARC%, %FULLREARARC%, and extending the midway line to range 3, the following phrases are used to express specific spacial relationships between ships. <br><strong>• Behind:</strong> If ship A is in the %FULLREARARC% of ship B and ship A does not cross the midway line of ship B, then ship A is <strong>behind</strong> ship B. <br><strong>• In front of:</strong> If ship A is in the %FULLFRONTARC% of ship B and ship A does not cross the midway line of ship B, then ship A is <strong>in front of</strong> ship B.<br><strong>• Flanking:</strong> If ship A crosses the midway line of ship B, then ship A is <strong>flanking</strong> ship B.<br><br><h5>Turret Arcs</h5><br>Unlike other arcs, some weapons use turret arc indicators to select arcs.<br>There are two types of turret arc indicators: single turret (%SINGLETURRETARC%) and double turret (%DOUBLETURRETARC%). During setup, a ship with a primary (or special) %SINGLETURRETARC% or %DOUBLETURRETARC% weapon adds the corresponding turret arc indicator to its base. <br>The turret arc indicator points toward one of the ship’s four standard arcs. <br>The standard arc that the turret arc indicator is pointing toward is a %SINGLETURRETARC% in addition to still being a standard arc. While a ship performs a %SINGLETURRETARC% attack, it can attack a target that is in its %SINGLETURRETARC% arc. <br>A ship with a double turret arc indicator has two %SINGLETURRETARC% in opposite directions. <br>A ship can adjust which standard arc(s) that its turret arc indicator is pointing towards by using the rotate (%ROTATEARC%) action. <br>Huge ships have additional rules for turret arc indicators (see Appendix: Huge Ships). <br><br><h5>Firing Arcs</h5> A ship’s <strong>firing arcs</strong> include all shaded arcs on the ship’s ship token plus all %SINGLETURRETARC% arcs, if any. <br>• If an upgrade card gives a ship a %SINGLETURRETARC% arc or primary weapon with a specified arc, those arcs are also firing arcs."""

Declare Target:</strong> During this step, the attacking player identifies and names the defender of the attack. <br>a. <strong>Measure Range:</strong> The attacking player measures range from the attacker to any number of enemy ships and determines which enemy ships are in which of its arcs. <br>b. <strong>Choose Weapon:</strong> The attacking player chooses one of the attacker’s primary or special weapons. <br>c. <strong>Declare Defender:</strong> The attacking player chooses an enemy ship to be the defender. The defender must meet the requirements defined by the weapon. <br>d. <strong>Pay Costs:</strong> The attacker must pay any costs for performing the attack. <br><br>• During the Declare Target step, the attack arc is the arc that corresponds to the chosen weapon. The attack range is determined by measuring range from the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the defender that is in the attack arc. <br>• A primary weapon requires the attack range to be range 0-3. A primary weapon has no cost by default. <br>• Special weapons have different requirements specified by the source of the attack. <br>• Unless it has an ability that allows attacks at range 0, a ship cannot attack a ship at range 0, even if the attack range would be range 1. <br>• If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon, or if the attacker cannot pay the costs required for the attack, the attacking player either chooses a different weapon or chooses not to attack. <br><br><strong>2. Attack Dice:</strong> During this step, the attacking player rolls attack dice and the players can modify the dice. <br>a. <strong>Roll Attack Dice:</strong> The attacking player determines the number of attack dice to roll. Starting with the attack value, modifiers that increase or decrease the number of attack dice (such as range bonus and other effects) are applied. Next, if any minimum or maximum number of dice has been set, that limit is applied. There is always a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6. Then they roll that many dice. <br>• While performing a primary attack at attack range 0, attack dice cannot be added, unless stated otherwise <br>b. <strong>Modify Attack Dice:</strong> The players resolve abilities that modify the attack dice. The defending player resolves their abilities first, then the attacking player resolves their abilities. <br><br>• While performing a primary attack at attack range 0,the attacker's dice cannot be modified, except by the defender. <br><br>• The most common ways the attacker modifies attack dice are by spending a focus token or spending a lock it has on the defender. <br>• Each attack die cannot be rerolled more than once during an attack. <br><br><strong>3. Defense Dice:</strong> During this step, the defending player rolls a number of defense dice equal to the ship’s agility value and the players can modify the dice. <br>a. <strong>Roll Defense Dice:</strong> The defending player determines a number of defense dice to roll. Starting with the defender’s agility value, modifiers that increase or decrease the number of defense dice (such as range bonus, whether the attack is being obstructed by an obstacle, and other effects) are applied. Next, if any minimum or maximum number of dice has been set, that limit is applied. There is always a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6. Then they roll that many dice. <br>b. <strong>Modify Defense Dice:</strong> The players resolve abilities that modify the defense dice. The attacking player resolves their abilities first, then the defending player resolves their abilities. <br><br>• While defending at range 0, enemy ships cannot cancel, modify, or remove dice or results <br><br>• The most common ways the defender modifies defense dice are by spending a focus or evade token. <br>• Each defense die cannot be rerolled more than once during an attack. <br><br><strong>4. Neutralize Results:</strong> During this step, pairs of attack and defense dice <strong>neutralize</strong> each other. Dice are neutralized in the following order: <br>a. Pairs of %EVADE% and %HIT% results are canceled. <br>b. Pairs of %EVADE% and %CRIT% results are canceled. <br>The attack hits if at least one %HIT% or %CRIT% result remains uncanceled; otherwise, the attack misses. <br><br><strong>5. Deal Damage:</strong> If the attack hits, the defender suffers damage for each uncanceled %HIT% and %CRIT% result in the following order: <br>a. The defender suffers 1 %HIT% damage for each uncanceled %HIT% result. Then cancel all %HIT% results. <br>b. The defender suffers 1 %CRIT% damage for each uncanceled %CRIT% result. Then cancel all %CRIT% results. <br><br><strong>6. Aftermath:</strong> Abilities that trigger after an attack are resolved in the following order. <br>a. Resolve any of the defending player’s abilities that trigger after a ship defends or is destroyed, excluding abilities that grant a bonus attack. <br>b. Resolve any of the attacking player’s abilities that trigger after a ship performs an attack or is destroyed, excluding abilities that grant a bonus attack. <br>c. Resolve any of the defending player’s abilities that trigger after a ship defends or is destroyed that grant a bonus attack. <br>d. Resolve any of the attacking player’s abilities that trigger after a ship performs an attack or is destroyed that grant a bonus attack. <br><br>• Each ship may perform one standard attack when it engages during the Engagement Phase. <br>• If a ship is destroyed at an initiative step during the Engagement Phase, the ship is not removed until all ships of the attacker’s initiative have engaged. <br>• During an attack, a ship cannot choose to roll fewer dice than it is supposed to roll. <br>• If a player would roll more dice than they have available, keep track of the rolled results and reroll the dice necessary to equal the total number of dice the player would have rolled all at once.

These have exceptions to the standard rules for executing a maneuver. <br><strong>• Koiogran Turn:</strong> The %UTURN% (Koiogran turn) bearing advances a ship straight forward, changing its facing by 180º.

While it defends, a ship can spend any number of %FORCE% during the Defense Dice step to change that number of its %FOCUS% results to %EVADE% results. <br>• If an upgrade card has a Force capacity, this increases the Force capacity of the ship. The %FORCE% are placed above the ship card it is attached to (not the upgrade card). <br>◊ A ship card that does not have a Force capacity on its ship card has a Force capacity of “0,” but that capacity can be increased by upgrade cards that have a Force capacity. <br>◊ If a ship has multiple sources of recurring %FORCE%, the recurring values do not stack. During the End Phase, each ship with a Force capacity recovers a number of %FORCE% equal the highest number of recurring %FORCE% symbols among the cards that grant it a Force capacity. For example, if a ship with a Force capacity of "0" has two %CREW% cards that each grant it a Force capacity of "+1" and have one recurring %FORCE% symbol each, that ship has a Force capacity of "2," but recovers only one %FORCE% during the End Phase. <br>◊ If an upgrade card instructs the ship to spend %FORCE%, those %FORCE% are spent from the ship card. <br><br><h5>Shield (%SHIELD%)</h5> Shields (%SHIELD%) represent defensive energy barriers.

When that ship performs an attack that is obstructed by an obstacle it ignores the effects of the obstruction, so the defender does not roll 1 additional defense die being obstructed by the obstacles the attacker is ignoring. <br><br>However, the obstacles are still treated as being present for effects that check for their presence or absence (such as the Stunned Pilot damage card or Debris Gambit [%TALENT%]). Additionally, an attack is obstructed by an obstacle even while the effects of the obstacle are ignored. This applies to cards such as Outrider [%TITLE%], Han Solo [Pilot, Customized YT-1300], and Trick Shot (%TALENT%). <br><br>Additionally, other ships do not ignore the obstacle when resolving effects that interact with a ship that is ignoring obstacles.

Sabine only affects devices classified as bombs, not mines and other devices, such as a Proximity Mine. <br><br><strong>Q: How do fuse markers (pg. 11) interact with Mines?</strong> <br><br>A: If a ship would move through and/or overlap a fused Mine, one fuse marker is removed from the mine and it does not detonate, even if the ship remains physically on top of the mine after the fuse marker is removed. <br><br>If a ship is physically on top of a mine that did not detonate because of the effect of a fuse marker, and it moves through and/or overlaps that mine again during a later move, the mine detonates as normal. <br><br><strong>Q: If the Loose Cargo from Rigged Cargo Chute [%ILLICIT%] or Spare Parts from Spare Parts Canister [%MODIFICATION%] overlaps another ship, what happens?</strong> <br><br>A: It is placed underneath the ship, and the ship overlaps it, suffering its effects. <br><br><strong>Q: If a remote has no arcs, can abilities that resolve “while not in the defender’s %FRONTARC% (or other arc)” resolve?</strong><br><br>A: No. A ship cannot be outside of any of a remote’s arcs if that remote has no arcs.<br><br><strong>Q: What happens when a Proximity Mine is dropped such that two or more ships overlap it?</strong> <br><br>A: The owner of the Proximity Mine chooses one ship to be affected by it. <br><br><strong>Q: What happens when a set of Cluster Mines are dropped such that two or more ships overlap them?</strong> <br><br>A: The owner of the Cluster Mines first chooses one ship to be affected by each of the individual Cluster Mine. Then, in an order of that player's choosing, the dice are rolled to resolve the effect of the detonation on each of those ships. <br><br><strong>Q: When two or more devices detonate at the same time, who chooses the order of the resolution of their effects?</strong> <br><br>A: The first player resolves all of their devices in any order of their choosing, resolving each detonation and then any resultant effects (such as Sabine Wren [%CREW%]'s "after an enemy ship is affected by a friendly bomb" effect) fully before moving on to the next. Then the second player in player order resolves all of their bombs in any order of their choosing, resolving each detonation fully before moving on to the next (and so on, for multiplayer games).<br><br><strong>Q: When a ship overlaps an Electro-Chaff Cloud, which player determines the effect of the jam token?</strong> <br><br>A: The player whose ship is overlapping the Electro-Chaff Cloud determines which green token or lock is removed/broken.

A purple action's %FORCE% cost is a "cost to attempt to perform [that] purple action" (see Actions) and is still paid even if the action fails. <br><br><strong>Q: If Anakin Skywalker [Naboo Royal N-1] uses his pilot ability to barrel roll (note that this is not a %BARRELROLL% action) and fails, must he still spend the %FORCE%?</strong> <br><br>A: No. A barrel roll can fail in the same manner as a %BARRELROLL% action, but because Anakin's ability is not an action, the %FORCE% cost is a cost to resolve the effect (which Anakin cannot do in the case of failure) rather than a cost to attempt the action. <br><br><strong>Q: Does Sense [%FORCEPOWER%] require you to spend 1 %FORCE% before measuring range to other ships?</strong> <br><br>A: No. You can measure range to see which ships are at range 0–1 and which ships are at range 0–3 before deciding whether or not to spend the %FORCE% to affect a ship at range 0–3. <br><br><strong>Q: If a Quadrijet Transfer Spacetug uses its "Spacetug Tractor Array" action and cannot choose a ship in its front arc at range 1, what happens?</strong><br><br>A: The action fails.<br><br><strong>Q: While a ship executes a Tallon Roll maneuver, if it cannot be placed at the middle position (center line aligned to the center line of the template), is it able to fully execute the maneuver?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes, provided there is a valid position at which to place it. While executing a Tallon Roll, if a ship can be placed in at least one of the three possible positions (center line aligned to the front, middle, or back of the template), it must choose one of the valid positions, and it fully executes the maneuver. If a valid position exists, it cannot choose an invalid position to partially complete the maneuver. As with a barrel roll, while resolving this, the player may attempt to place the ship at the front, middle, and back before choosing a valid position. <br><br><strong>Q: Can Ved Foslo [TIE Advanced x1] use his ship ability to reduce the speed of a [1 %BANKLEFT%] or [1 %BANKRIGHT%] maneuver, allowing him to execute a [0 %BANKLEFT%] or [0 %BANKRIGHT%] maneuver?</strong> <br><br>A: No. 0-speed bank maneuvers can only be executed by huge ships, and cannot be executed by standard ships even if a particular ship has the ability to execute a maneuver that is not on its dial. <br><br><strong>Q: What is the difference between "flipping a dial faceup" and "revealing a dial," and when does each apply?</strong> <br><br>A: "Flipping a dial faceup" is the manual act of turning the dial such that the face of the dial (containing the maneuvers) is visible. "Revealing a dial" is the specific act that occurs during a ship's activation. A ship that reveals its dial does flip the dial faceup as part of this process. <br><br>However, other effects that refer to "flipping a dial faceup," such as the Informant (%CREW%) upgrade's Listening Device condition do not "reveal" the dial for the purposes of abilities that trigger when a dial is revealed. Additionally, a ship that has flipped its dial faceup can still "reveal" that dial at the appropriate time during its activation (and trigger any relevant effects from doing so), even though the dial is already faceup."""
        "ENGAGEMENT PHASE AND ATTACKING":
            name: "Engagement Phase and Attacking"
            text: """<strong>Q: When a ship is destroyed by a game effect triggered with “before engaging,” does it still engage?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes, because the game has already reached that initiative step, it is not removed until after all ships of that initiative have engaged, per simultaneous fire. <br><br><strong>Q: When specifically during an attack do effects that apply "while you perform an attack" or "while you defend" apply?</strong> <br><br>A: Abilities are applied at the step in the attack at which they take effect. For example, in the case of Predator, as this is a dice modification, it is applied at Step 2b: Modify Attack Dice. Note, however, that effects resolved during Step 2b: Modify Attack Dice and 3b: Modify Defense Dice do not use the ability queue, as they are resolved in the order described in that section of the rules reference. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship is destroyed, when are effects that trigger upon its destruction resolved?</strong> <br><br>A: If it was destroyed during an attack, these are resolved during Step 6: Aftermath. <br><br>Otherwise, these effects are added to the ability queue immediately (even if the ship would not yet be removed, such as due to the Simultaneous Fire rule or a card effect). <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship is destroyed and an effect such as R1-J5 [%ASTROMECH%] repairs one or more of its damage cards before it is removed, is the ship still destroyed (and thus removed)?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. After a ship becomes "destroyed" for any reason, it remains destroyed no matter what effects are resolved before it is removed. Effects can change the timing at which a ship is removed, but cannot undo the state of being destroyed."""
        "ABILITIES AND THE ABILITY QUEUE":
            name: "Abilities and the Ability Queue"
            text: """<strong>Q: What makes an effect an "ability?"</strong> <br><br>A: An ability is text from a card a player controls (such a ship card, upgrade card, damage card, remote card, device, condition card, etc). <br><br>A few abilities are constant (such as the "Gain a %FRONTARC% primary weapon with a value of '3'" portion of Moldy Crow). Constant abilities are not resolved via the ability queue. <br><br>Most abilities are triggered, occurring only at a specified timing window (such as the "During the End Phase, do not remove up to 2 focus tokens" portion of Moldy Crow). Triggered abilities are resolved via the ability queue. <br><br>Each triggered ability has the following parts: <br>A timing (when the ability is added to the ability queue) <br>An effect (what the ability does) <br>Additionally, an ability can have one or more of the following: <br>One or more requirements the ship must meet <br>One or more costs the ship must pay <br>A text box can contain multiple abilities if there are multiple constant abilities or triggers that can add an ability to the queue (as in the Moldy Crow example). <br><br><strong>Q: What is meant by a requirement for an ability?</strong> <br><br>A: A requirement for an ability is a conditional if-statement, such as "if you are tractored" or "if the defender is in your bullseye arc." A ship being inarc at range for an attack made as part of a triggered ability, such as Snap Shot or Foresight, is also a requirement for that ability. <br><br>If an ability's requirements are not met at the time the ability would be added to the queue, it cannot be added to the queue. <br><br>If the ability's requirements are not met at the time the ability would be resolved from the queue, the ability is not resolved and is instead removed from the queue. <br><br>If an ability instructs you to make a choice, such as choosing a ship, that is not itself a requirement to initiate an ability. <br><br><strong>Q: When is the cost for an ability paid?</strong> <br><br>A: The cost for an ability is paid when the ability is resolved. An ability cannot be added to the queue if its cost could not be paid at the time it is added. <br><br>If an ability's cost cannot be paid when it would be resolved from the queue, the ability is not resolved and is instead removed from the queue. The ability's cost is not paid. <br><br>An ability can have multiple costs. If it does, all costs must be paid to resolve it. If all costs cannot be paid, no costs are paid and the ability is removed from the queue and not resolved.<br><br><strong>Q: Are optional abilities added to the ability queue automatically when they are triggered, or does a player make their choice by adding the ability to the queue?</strong> <br><br>A: They are added to the ability queue automatically when they are triggered as long as they meet the requirements to be added. Players are not required to declare each ability as it enters the queue. However, if a player does not resolve an ability during the appropriate timing window, the opportunity to do so is lost.<br><br>For example, Afterburners and Fine-Tuned Controls are both optional abilities that are added to the ability queue "after you fully execute a maneuver." A Delta-7 Aethersprite equipped with Afterburners would add both abilities to the queue in an order of its player's choosing. <br><br>Note that at an ability can be added to the queue only if the requirements for it could be met. For instance, if Afterburners had no active %CHARGE% remaining, or if the Delta-7 Aethersprite had no active %FORCE% after it executed the maneuver, those abilities could not be added, respectively. <br><br><strong>Q: Are optional abilities added to the ability queue mandatory once they have been added?</strong> <br><br>A: No. When an ability is reached in the ability queue, the player makes the relevant choices for that ability, including whether or not to use it. For example, if a Delta-7 Aethersprite queues Fine-Tuned Controls and then Afterburners after it fully executes a maneuver, when the queue reaches Fine-Tuned Controls, its player makes the choice whether to pay the costs to resolve the ability, then does so. Then, when the queue reaches Afterburners, its player makes the choice whether to pay the costs to resolve the ability, then resolves it and makes any choices included in the ability. <br><br>Q: How are abilities that "may choose a ship" (e.g. K-2SO [%CREW%] or Darth Vader [%CREW%]) resolved when they are reached in the ability queue? <br><br>A: When an ability that "may choose a ship" is reached in the ability queue, before paying costs, the ship's player may measure range to any number of ships. Then, that player may choose a ship from among the valid options as defined by the ability, or choose no ship. If they choose no ship, the costs for the ability are not paid, and the ability is removed from the queue without resolving."""
        "SPECIFIC CARD QUESTIONS":
            name: "Specific Card Questions"
            text: """<strong>Q: Can Cikatro Vizago [%CREW%] exchange an %ILLICIT% upgrade card onto a ship that could not normally equip it (such as equipping a Stealth Device to a Z-95 Headhunter and then exchanging it with a Rigged Cargo Chute on a YV-666)?</strong> <br><br>A: No. Cikatro Vizago cannot move the Rigged Cargo Chute to the Z-95 due to the Z-95 not meeting the “Medium or large ship” restriction on Rigged Cargo Chute, as described in Upgrade Cards. <br><br><strong>Q: When attacking with a weapon with the ordnance icon (such as Proton Rockets) or defending against an attack with the ordnance icon, can Grand Inquisitor [TIE/Advanced v1] apply the range bonus?</strong> <br><br>A: No. <br><br><strong>Q: Is Han Solo [Rebel, %GUNNER%]’s additional attack a bonus attack?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Anything that permits an attack outside of the standard attack allowed to a ship when it engages is a bonus attack. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship with Han Solo [Rebel, %GUNNER%] is made to engage at initiative 7 (through Roark Garnet [HWK-290], Heightened Reflexes [%FORCEPOWER%], etc.), must it perform Han Solo’s bonus attack first?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Han Solo [Rebel, %GUNNER%]’s effect occurs at initiative 7 before any ship at that initiative engages (including the one to which Han Solo is equipped), so Han Solo’s bonus attack is always performed first. This means that it cannot perform Han Solo’s bonus attack and then perform a subsequent attack from the same turret arc. <br><br><strong>Q: How do effects that “prevent damage” such as Iden Versio interact with effects such as Ion Cannon and Tractor Beam that “inflict [ion, tractor, jam, etc] tokens instead of dealing damage”?</strong> <br><br>A: If an effect uses %HIT%/%CRIT% results for an effect instead of dealing damage (such as inflicting ion, tractor, or jam tokens), that effect cannot be prevented by an effect that “prevents damage.” <br><br>Note that Iden Versio can prevent the 1 damage that an Ion Cannon deals before inflicting ion tokens, but this does not prevent Iden Versio from gaining the subsequent ion tokens. <br><br><strong>Q: When the Nashtah Pup deploys, does it gain charges equal to the charge limit from the ship card with the Hound’s Tooth?</strong> <br><br>A: No, when the Nashtah Pup deploys via emergency deployment, it gains the number of active and inactive charges that the ship with the Hound’s Tooth had before it was destroyed. <br><br><strong>Q: Does the Autopilot Drone [Escape Craft]’s ability trigger if it is destroyed by another method other than running out of charges?</strong> <br><br>A: No. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship with Cloaking Device [%ILLICIT%] rolls a focus result and then fails while attempting to decloak, what happens?</strong> <br><br>A: The ship does not remove its cloak token. <br><br><strong>Q: Can a ship use Elusive [%TALENT%] to recover charges on other upgrades by fully executing red maneuvers?</strong> <br><br>A: No. Elusive and other effects that refer to recovering charges only apply to the charges of that specific card, unless the effect explicitly states otherwise (such as Chopper [Rebel, Crew]). <br><br><strong>Q: Does Kavil (Scum, BTL-A4 Y-wing) roll an additional attack die when attacking with a turret weapon when the turret arc indicator is set to his front arc?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Additionally, note that Kavil would roll an additional attack die when performing an attack that specifies bullseye arc, even though the target is also by definition in his front arc. <br><br><strong>Q: If Lieutenant Sai [Lambda-class Shuttle] coordinates a ship and it performs an action followed by a linked action, can Lieutenant Sai perform the linked action instead of the initial action?</strong><br><br>A: No. Lieutenant Sai can only perform the initial action. <br><br><strong>Q: Airen Cracken [Z-95 Headhunter]’s pilot ability allows another friendly ship to “perform an action, treating it as red.” Can that ship choose to perform a red action, treating it as red? Can it choose to perform a purple action, treating it as red?</strong> <br><br>A: It can perform a red action, treating it as red. However, because purple is more difficult than red, it cannot perform a purple action, treating it as red. <br><br><strong>Q: Does the StarViper-class Attack Platform’s ship ability (Microthrusters) apply to the barrel roll that results from becoming tractored?</strong> <br><br>A: Microthrusters does affect this barrel roll. The player whose effect assigned the tractor token determines the direction and position of the template. <br><br><strong>Q: Do TIE Strikers (and Reapers) skip their perform action step if they overlap an asteroid or another ship with their Aileron’s ability maneuver?</strong> <br><br>A: No. It is only during the Execute Maneuver step that a ship skips its Perform Action step for overlapping a ship or obstacle. <br><br><strong>Q: Can a TIE Advanced x1 that rolled 1 additional die from Advanced Targeting Computer spend the lock later in the attack? If it does, can it change 1 %HIT% into a %CRIT%?</strong> <br><br>A: While performing an attack, a TIE Advanced x1 can spend its lock to reroll attack dice after rolling 1 additional die. <br><br>It can also change 1 %HIT% result to a %CRIT% result and then spend the lock to reroll attack dice. However, note that it cannot change 1 %HIT% result to a %CRIT% result after spending the lock, as it no longer has the defender locked. <br><br><strong>Q: After being destroyed, can “Deathfire” [TIE Bomber] launch a device that cannot normally be launched?</strong> <br><br>A: No. <br><br><strong>Q: If "Deathfire" [TIE Bomber] (or a ship with Paige Tico [%GUNNER%] equipped) placed a device during the System Phase, can that ship drop a bomb after being destroyed?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. A ship can only place a device once during the System Phase, but it can drop an additional bomb as instructed by its pilot (or upgrade) ability. Note however that some cards that can place devices at times other than the System Phase (such as Edon Kappehl [MG-100 Starfortress] and “Genius” [%ASTROMECH%]) contain the text “If you have not dropped or launched a bomb this round,” which would prevent them from placing a subsequent device if they had placed one in the System Phase. <br><br><strong>Q: What ship’s initiative does Listening Device condition assigned by Informant [%CREW%] trigger at?</strong> <br><br>A: Listening Device’s effect triggers at the initiative of the ship that has the condition. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship would gain a disarm token as part of paying the cost of an effect, such as Foreman Proach [Modified TIE/ln Fighter] or Quinn Jast [M3-A Interceptor], but Overseer Yushyn [Modified TIE/ln Fighter] causes them to gain a stress token instead, does the effect still resolve?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Overseer Yushyn [Modified TIE/ln Fighter]’s ability is a replacement effect, and if it replaces part of the cost a ship would pay to resolve an effect (in this case, the disarm token that ship would gain), that effect still resolves (see page 2, “Paying Costs”). <br><br>Note that abilities that would resolve “after a ship gains a disarm token” still do not resolve, as this is a timing window that has not occurred, rather than a cost that has been replaced. <br><br><strong>Q: If an attack made with Plasma Torpedoes [%TORPEDO%] hits, when does the defender lose a shield?</strong> <br><br>A: It is determined that the attack hit at the end of Step 4: Neutralize Results. Therefore, the ship loses the shield at the end of Step 4: Neutralize Results and before Step 5: Deal Damage. <br><br><strong>Q: What happens if a ship transfers its own lock to itself (such as by using Admiral Holdo [%CREW%])?</strong> <br><br>A: A ship cannot have a lock on itself (see Lock), so that lock breaks. <br><br><strong>Q: When an effect checks the difficulty of your revealed maneuver (such as Cova Nell’s pilot ability), do any effects that alter the difficulty of your maneuvers (such as R4 Astromech [%ASTROMECH%] or Leia Organa [Resistance, %CREW% %CREW%] apply?</strong> <br><br>A: No. The difficulty of a revealed maneuver matches its printed color. The speed and bearing of a revealed maneuver also match their printed value and type, respectively. <br><br><strong>Q: When an effect (such as Seasoned Navigator) instructs a ship to set its dial to a different maneuver "after you reveal your dial," is the ship's revealed maneuver the one that was on the dial when it was revealed or the new maneuver to which it is set?</strong> <br><br>A: The ship's revealed maneuver is the one to which its dial is physically set. If an effect such as Seasoned Navigator physically sets the dial to a new maneuver, the new maneuver is the ship's revealed maneuver. If multiple effects set the dial, the revealed maneuver is the final maneuver on the dial after all effects that set it have been resolved. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship is affected by Padmé Amidala’s pilot ability and it modifies 1 of its %FOCUS% results, can Emperor Palpatine [%CREW%, Empire]’s ability be used to modify a second %FOCUS% result?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. The ship equipped with Emperor Palpatine (Crew) is modifying that ship’s second focus result, and not that ship itself. <br><br><strong>Q: If an effect applies a maximum to the number of dice rolled (e.g. Seventh Fleet Gunner [%GUNNER%] or Predictive Shot [%FORCEPOWER%]) and another effect instructs it to roll additional dice in excess of this maximum, does the order in which the effects were applied matter?</strong> <br><br>A: No. Once an effect sets a maximum number of dice that can be rolled (“roll 1 additional die, to a maximum of X” or “the defender cannot roll more than X defense dice”), that maximum is applied at Step 2a: Roll Attack Dice or Step 2b: Roll Defense Dice (see Attack) after all effects that cause the ship to roll additional or fewer dice have been applied. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship with agility 0 (such as the VCX-100) is subject to one effect that would cause it to roll 1 fewer defense die and another effect that would cause it to roll 1 additional defense die, does the order in which these effects are applied change how many defense dice it rolls?</strong> <br><br>A: No. Whichever effect is applied first, it rolls 0 defense dice. If the reduction is applied first, its defense pool becomes “–1 dice” (negative 1 defense dice), then the positive modifier is applied, bringing it back to 0. On the other hand, if the increase is applied first, the decrease subsequently reduces it back to 0. <br><br>Note that after modifiers are applied but before dice are rolled, there is a default minimum of 0 dice (see Attack). Therefore if a ship would roll fewer than 0 dice due to the modifiers that have been applied, it always rolls 0 defense dice instead. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship with agility 0 (such as the VCX-100) is strained and defends against an attack at attack range 1 (for which it would normally roll 0 defense die), does it remove the strain token?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Although it cannot be made to roll fewer than 0 defense dice due to the intrinsic minimum, the effect of “roll 1 fewer defense die” is applied (see Attack), and so the strain token is removed. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship that is equipped with Kanan Jarrus [Crew] uses Inertial Dampeners [Illicit] to perform a white stationary maneuver, in which order to Kanan's ability and the "gain 1 stress token" portion of Inertial Dampeners' ability occur?</strong> <br><br>A: Both abilities have the same timing window: after the ship executes the maneuver. Thus, after the ship executes the white stationary maneuver, if the player chooses to spend one Force charge to activate Kanan, two abilities enter the ability queue: Inertial Dampeners' "gain 1 stress token" and Kanan Jarrus' "remove 1 stress token." The player who controls both effects determines the order they enter the queue, and then the abilities resolve in that order. If a player wants the ship to gain and then remove a stress token, Inertial Dampeners' ability should be placed into the queue before Kanan's ability. <br><br><strong>Q: Dalan Oberos [M12-L Kimogila]'s pilot ability reads "At the start of the Engagement Phase, you may choose 1 shielded enemy ship in your bullseye arc and spend 1 charge. If you do, that ship loses 1 shield and you recover 1 shield." Must both "that ship loses 1 shield" and "you recover 1 shield" be able to resolve for either to resolve?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. "That ship loses 1 shield and you recover 1 shield" is a single effect, and so both parts must be able to resolve for either to occur. <br><br><strong>Q: Do Paige Tico [%GUNNER%] and "Deathfire" [TIE Bomber]'s abilities supersede the "one device per round" limitation?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. These abilities allow one ship to drop a second device in the same round (at the relevant timing windows), as they do not include the "if you have not dropped or launched a device this round" limitation (as included on Edon Kappehl). <br><br><strong>Q: If an effect says that a ship "loses a shield" (or "loses shields"), has that ship suffered damage?</strong> <br><br>A: No. While suffering damage does cause a ship to lose shields (if applicable), if an effect causes a ship to lose one or more shields directly, it has not suffered damage. <br><br><strong>Q: How is Han Solo [Rebel, Modified YT-1300]'s ability categorized? Is it a dice modification? Is it a reroll? What is its timing window?</strong> <br><br>A: Han Solo's ability is treated as a dice modification effect that is not a reroll. Because it is a dice modification effect, when attacking or defending, it triggers during the Modify Dice step. Note, however, that it can also affect other die rolls, such as the roll to determine if a ship suffers damage from overlapping or moving through an asteroid. 
            <br><br><strong>Q: How does Han Solo [Rebel, Modified YT-1300]'s ability interact with C-3PO [Rebel, Crew]?</strong> <br><br>A: The "if you do and you roll exactly that many evade results..." portion of C-3PO's ability triggers occurs after the dice are rolled, before the Modify Dice step. Thus, Han Solo's effect occurs after C-3PO's effect has been resolved. If using Han Solo after using C-3PO, the added die must be rerolled. <br><br><strong>Q: How does Han Solo [Rebel, Modified YT-1300]'s ability interact with "Midnight" [TIE/fo Fighter]?</strong> <br><br>A: "Midnight" prevents dice modification. Because Han Solo's ability is a dice modification effect, "Midnight" prevents it from being used. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship executes a stationary maneuver in arc at range 2 of an enemy ship with Snap Shot equipped (or in the bullseye arc of an enemy ship with Foresight equipped), can the ship with Snap Shot (or Foresight) perform the bonus attack?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. <br><br><strong>Q: While "Scourge" Skutu performs an attack using Snap Shot, if the defender is in "Scourge" Skutu's bullseye arc, does "Scourge" Skutu add an additional attack die?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship with the Fine-Tuned Controls ship ability (or another ability that triggers "after you execute/fully execute a maneuver") fully executes a maneuver in arc at range 2 of a ship equipped with Snap Shot, how is this resolved?</strong> <br><br>A: This is resolved one of several ways depending on which player is first player. <br><br>In all cases, both abilities ("After you fully execute a maneuver, you may spend 1 force charge to perform a boost or barrel roll action" and "After an enemy ship executes a maneuver, you may perform this attack against it as a bonus attack") are added to the ability queue. <br><br>If the first player controls the ship with Fine-Tune Controls, that player resolves this ability before Snap Shot is resolved. If, after performing a boost or barrel roll, the ship with Fine-Tuned Controls is no longer in range or arc to be chosen as a target for Snap Shot, Snap Shot cannot be resolved and is removed from the queue. <br><br>If the second player controls the ship with Fine-Tuned Controls, their opponent resolves Snap Shot first. <br><br><strong>Q: How do abilities that alter the speed, difficulty, and/or bearing of a maneuver that a ship reveals during its Reveal Dial step and executes during its Execute Maneuver step resolve? For example, if Hera Syndulla [Attack Shuttle] is equipped with R4 Astromech and Seasoned Navigator, and also has the Damaged Engine Damage Card, what happens?</strong> <br><br>A: R4 Astromech and Damaged Engine (and other constant effects that alter the difficulty of a maneuver, such as Nien Nunb [Crew], L3-37's Programming, and Leia Organa [Rebel and Resistance, Crew]) apply only during the Execute Maneuver step, for effects that trigger "before a ship executes a maneuver" (e.g. BB Astromech), and for effects that trigger "after that ship executes a maneuver" (e.g. Elusive). <br><br>So, after Hera's dial is revealed, Hera's player may add Hera's pilot ability and Seasoned Navigator's ability to the ability queue in either order. Both abilities resolve, and if Seasoned Navigator's ability is resolved, the difficulty of the maneuver is increased during the Execute Maneuver step (i.e. the difficulty has not yet been increased when Hera's pilot ability is resolved). <br><br>Then, during the Execute Maneuver step, all abilities that alter the difficulty of the maneuver are cumulative as normal. <br><br>Note that abilities that alter a maneuver without causing the ship to select a new maneuver on its dial do not affect the ship's "revealed maneuver" as referenced by abilities such as Ric Olié's pilot ability. <br><br><strong>Q: After a Nantex-class starfighter executes its maneuver, if it uses its Pinpoint Tractor Array ship ability to assign a tractor token to itself so that it can rotate its turret arc, and then it barrel rolls itself over a debris field as a result of becoming tractored, giving it a stress token, how does this resolve?</strong> <br><br>A: After a Nantex-class starfighter executes its maneuver, it has the option to add an ability in the queue with the effect of "gain 1 tractor token to perform a %ROTATEARC% action." <br><br>When this ability resolves, the Nantex-class starfighter pays the cost ("gain 1 tractor token") to resolve this effect. The Nantex-class starfighter gains 1 tractor token, then performs the rotate action. Note that it does not resolve the game effect of becoming tractored (which triggers after the first time a ship becomes tractored each round) until after it fully resolves the ability by completing the rotate action. <br><br>Once the ability is fully resolved, the game effect that triggers after a ship becomes tractored is applied to the Nantex-class starfighter (before any other abilities on the queue are resolved), prompting the Nantex-class starfighter's player to move it, if they desire. If they do and this movement takes the Nantex-class starfighter onto a debris cloud, it resolves the effects of moving through or overlapping the debris cloud, including gaining 1 stress token. <br><br>Finally, any other abilities on the queue are then resolved in order. <br><br><strong>Q: Can Snap Shot or Foresight be chosen as a special weapon to be used for a ship's attack during the Engagement Phase?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. The phrase "after an enemy ship executes a maneuver, you may perform this attack against it as a bonus attack" allows the attack to be used as a bonus attack under the specified circumstances, but does not disqualify it from being used during the Engagement Phase. <br><br><strong>Q: Do abilities that reference upgrades of a specific type (such as Captain Jonus' pilot ability) affect upgrades with multiple types including that type?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. For example, Captain Jonus' pilot ability can be used with a friendly ship's Barrage Rockets [%MISSILE% %MISSILE%], and Paige Tico [%GUNNER%]'s ability can be used with Electro-Proton Bomb [%DEVICE% %MODIFICATION%]. Each of these upgrades has the qualifying type (%MISSILE% for Barrage Rockets and %DEVICE% for Electro-Proton Bomb) in addition to its other type. <br><br>Note that the Weapon Hardpoint ability does not behave this way, as it grants a special upgrade slot. <br><br><strong>Q: When searching for a damage card with Kaz's Fireball [%TITLE%], must you show that card to your opponent?</strong> <br><br>A: No. You are not required to show the card to your opponent. <br><br><strong>Q: Can a Fireball use its "Explosion with Wings" ship ability without any facedown damage card to pay the cost of "exposing 1 damage card" to resolve the effect of "remov[ing] 1 disarm token"?</strong> <br><br>A: No. As exposing a damage card is a cost for removing the damage card, if the cost cannot be payed, the effect cannot be resolved. <br><br><strong>Q: If "Rush" becomes damaged during the Engagement Phase before the initiative 2 step, causing its initiative to become "6", what happens?</strong><br><br>A: "Rush" engages at the current initiative step, after all other ships at thatstep have engaged. <br><br><strong>Q: Does the Mining Guild TIE's Notched Stabilizers ship ability allow it to barrel roll through or onto asteroids? <br><br>A: Yes. <br><br>Q: Can Hondo Ohnaka (%CREW%) coordinate an enemy ship? If so, who chooses the action that ship performs?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes, Hondo can coordinate an enemy ship this way. When Hondo does so, the controller of the coordinated ship chooses the action. <br><br><strong>Q: When does Count Dooku (%CREW%)'s ability take effect?</strong> <br><br>A: Count Dooku's ability takes effect after the dice are rolled (before the Modify Dice step during an attack, or before other dice modification effects are applied for dice rolled at any other time). <br><br><strong>Q: What happens when two players use Count Dooku (%CREW%) on the same dice roll?</strong> <br><br>A: The first player's Count Dooku takes effect: if the roll does not contain the result the first player named, the ship's controlling player must choose one result and change it to the named result. <br><br>Then the second player's Count Dooku takes effect: if the roll does not contain the result the second player named,.the ship's controlling player must choose one result and change it to the named result. <br><br>This can potentially mean that the same die is modified twice this way. <br><br><strong>Q: Can the difficulty of a purple maneuver be reduced or increased?</strong> <br><br>A: No. However, effects can cause you to "treat the maneuver as [a different color]." <br><br><strong>Q: At what step of Setup does the "Explosion with Wings" (Fireball) occur?</strong> <br><br>A: During Step 6: Prepare Other Components, after the damage deck has been shuffled. <br><br><strong>Q: How does Chewbacca (Resistance, %CREW%) interact with the "Explosion with Wings" ship ability?</strong> <br><br>A: Chewbacca (Resistance, %CREW%)'s "Setup: Lose 1 %CHARGE%" ability occurs after the ship equipped with Chewbacca is placed during Step 5: Place Forces. <br><br>"Explosion with Wings" causes a ship to be dealt a damage card during Step 6: Prepare Other Components. <br><br>However, triggered abilities that do not have the "Setup:" header or explicitly mention a timing during Setup do not trigger during Setup. Thus, the second ability in Chewbacca's text ("After a friendly ship at range 0–3 is dealt 1 damage card, recover 1 %CHARGE%", which does not mention setup nor have the header, does not trigger from "Explosion with Wings." <br><br><strong>Q: Can "Holo" (TIE/ba Interceptor)'s ship ability transfer a red lock token that has been assigned to "Holo" to a friendly ship?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. That red token is included under "your tokens," so Holo can transfer it. <br><br><strong>Q: Can "Holo" (TIE/ba Interceptor)'s ship ability transfer a red lock token that has been assigned to another ship by "Holo" to a friendly ship?</strong> <br><br>A: No. "Holo" (TIE/ba Inteceptor)'s lock is a red token assigned to another ship. It is not considered "your token" for the purposes of that ability (or other abilities that refer to "your token). However, it is "Holo" (TIE/ba Inteceptor)'s lock, and is considered "your lock" for the purposes of any abilities that refer to "your lock." <br><br><strong>Q: After Leia Organa (Resistance, %CREW%) reduces the difficulty of a ship's maneuver, if the reduced difficulty is blue, can the ship use BB Astromech to perform a %BARRELROLL%?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Leia Organa (Resistance, %CREW%) has an ability that occurs after the dial is revealed, and BB Astromech's ability is resolved subsequently, before the ship executes its maneuver. <br><br><strong>Q: What does "closest valid attack range" as mentioned on Automated Target Priority mean exactly?</strong> 
            <br><br>A: The "closest valid attack range" is the closest attack range for a given attack that has one or more potential valid defenders. A valid defender is a ship at the proper attack range in arc that meets the requirements for the chosen attack (such as Attack [%LOCK%]). <br><br>For example, consider a TIE/sf fighter equipped with Concussion Missiles that has one enemy ship outside its %FRONTARC% at range 0, one enemy ship outside its %FRONTARC% at range 1, two enemy ships in its %FRONTARC% at range 2, and one enemy ship in its %FRONTARC% at range 3 (on which it has a lock). Its %SINGLETURRETARC% is in its %FRONTARC%. <br><br>The TIE/sf fighter measures range (determining the above information) and chooses a weapon as normal.<br><br>If it chooses its primary weapon, it determines the closest valid attack range as follows: <br><br>Range 0: The enemy ship outside its %FRONTARC% at range 0 is not in arc, so it cannot be selected. As there are no potential valid defenders at range 0, range 0 is not a valid attack range.<br><br>Range 1: The enemy ship outside its %FRONTARC% at attack range 1 is not in arc, so it cannot be selected. As there are no potential valid defenders at range 1, range 1 is not a valid attack range. <br><br>Range 2: There are 2 enemy ships in its 󲈫 at range 2. The attack does not have any special requirements. Thus, range 2 is a valid attack range. The attacking player can choose either of these two ships as the defender, regardless of which one is physically closer. <br><br>Range 3: There was at least one valid target at range 2, so range 3 cannot be the closest valid attack range. It cannot choose the ship in its %FRONTARC% at range 3. <br><br>It chooses its Concussion Missiles, it determines the closest valid attack range as follows: <br><br>Range 0: Range 0 is not a valid attack range for Concussion Missiles, so the enemy ship in its %FRONTARC% at range 0 cannot be selected. <br><br>Range 1: Range 1 is not a valid attack range for Concussion Missiles. Even if the enemy ship at range 1 was in arc, could not be selected. <br><br>Range 2: There are 2 enemy ships in its %FRONTARC% at range 2. However, Concussion Missiles has a special requirement of Attack (%LOCK%), and the attacker does not have a lock on either ship at range 2. Thus, range 2 is not a valid attack range for Concussion Missiles. <br><br>Range 3: There is an enemy ship in the attacker's %FRONTARC% at range 3, on which the attacker has a lock. Thus, attack range 3 is a valid attack range, and the ship at range 3 can be selected as the defender. <br><br>Note that if the TIE/sf had two locks, one on the ship at range 2 and the other on the ship at range 3, Range 2 would be the closest valid attack range and thus it would be required to choose the ship on which it had a lock at Range 2. <br><br><strong>Q: After an enemy ship executes a maneuver, if it is in multiple friendly ships’ bullseye arcs, how many times can Kalani (%TACTICALRELAY%) be triggered?</strong> <br><br>A: One time. <br><br><strong>Q: Do effects that apply “while you perform an attack” (such as Fire-Control System) remain in effect during the Aftermath step of the attack?</strong> <br><br>A: No. The Aftermath step occurs after every attack, but it is not part of the attack. Note that this means that a bonus attack performed during the Aftermath step is not subject to any “while you perform an attack” effects from the original attack. <br><br><strong>Q: When a ship is instructed to gain two or more tokens from a single effect (such as Admiral Sloane), does this resolve as a single instance of gaining two or more tokens or as two or more separate instances of gaining one token?</strong> <br><br>A: It resolves as a single instance of gaining two or more tokens. Thus, if a ship is instructed to gain two or more tokens from a single effect like Admiral Sloane, this only triggers abilities that occur “after you gain a token” once. <br><br><strong>Q: Can Major Rhymer perform a %TORPEDO% or %MISSILE% attack at attack range 0?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Major Rhymer's pilot ability supersedes the base rule that ships cannot perform attacks at range 0. <br><br><strong>Q: If a ship equipped with Thermal Detonators (%DEVICE%) chooses to drop two Thermal Detonators, does this count as one or two instances of dropping devices?</strong> <br><br>A: Unlike Cluster Mines (%DEVICE%), Thermal Detonators are dropped one at a time, and each Thermal Detonator dropped counts as a single instance of dropping a device. This means that: <br><br>• After Paige Tico (MG-100 Starfortress) drops each Thermal Detonator, she may spend 1 %CHARGE% to drop one additional Thermal Detonator. As she has only one charge, this normally means she can drop a maximum of 3 Thermal Detonators. <br><br>• After a ship with Paige Tico (%GUNNER%) is destroyed, that ship may drop one Thermal Detonator. <br><br>• Abilities that trigger after dropping a device trigger after each Thermal Detonator is dropped. In terms of sequence, the first Thermal Detonator is dropped, any abilities that trigger from this (such as Deathrain [TIE/ca Punisher] or Delayed Fuses [%MODIFICATION%]) are added to the queue and resolve, and then the second Thermal Detonator is dropped, and any abilities that trigger from this are added to the queue and resolved. <br><br>• Trajectory Simulator (%SENSOR%) can be used for up to one Thermal Detonator, but as the two devices must be dropped (or launched) with different templates, both cannot be launched this way. <br><br><strong>Q: Are left bank (or turn) and right bank (or turn) templates of the same speed considered different templates?</strong> <br><br>A: Yes. Even though these templates are resolved with the same physical tool, they are considered different templates. <br><br>For example, the [3 %TURNLEFT%] and [3 %TURNRIGHT%], which use the same physical tool, flipped over), they are considered different templates. Thus, if an effect requires you to choose "two different templates," you may select the [3 %TURNLEFT%] template and the [3 %TURNRIGHT%] template. <br><br><strong>Q: What is a structure as mentioned on Marg-Sabl Closure (%TALENT%)?</strong> <br><br>A: A structure is a... wait a second, I can't tell you that yet! You'll have to wait and see."""
